This module provides a simple account management system for a trading simulation platform. It includes functionalities for managing funds, buying and selling shares, tracking portfolio performance, and logging all transactions.

## Helper Function

### `get_share_price(symbol: str) -> float`

**Description:**
Simulates fetching the current market price for a given share symbol. This is a *test implementation* for demonstration purposes and would typically be replaced by an external API call in a production environment.

**Arguments:**
*   `symbol` (str): The stock ticker symbol (e.g., 'AAPL', 'TSLA', 'GOOGL').

**Returns:**
*   `float`: The current price of the share.

**Raises:**
*   `ValueError`: If the symbol is not recognized in the test data.

**Test Implementation Details:**
Returns fixed prices for 'AAPL' ($170.00), 'TSLA' ($250.00), and 'GOOGL' ($140.00). Other symbols will raise a `ValueError`.

## Class: `Account`

**Description:**
Manages a single user's trading simulation account. It encapsulates the user's cash balance, share holdings, and a history of all financial and trading transactions. It also provides methods to calculate portfolio value and profit/loss.

### `__init__(self, account_id: str)`

**Description:**
Initializes a new trading account with a unique identifier. Sets up initial cash balance, holdings, and an empty transaction history.

**Arguments:**
*   `account_id` (str): A unique string identifier for the account.

**Raises:**
*   `ValueError`: If the `account_id` is empty.

**Internal State:**
*   `_account_id` (str): Unique identifier for the account.
*   `_balance` (float): Current cash balance. Initialized to `0.0`.
*   `_holdings` (Dict[str, int]): Dictionary mapping share symbols (uppercase) to the quantity held. Initialized to `{}`.
*   `_transactions` (List[Dict[str, Any]]): A list of dictionaries, each representing a chronological transaction. Initialized to `[]`.
*   `_total_deposits_sum` (float): The cumulative sum of all funds ever deposited into the account. Used for P&L calculation. Initialized to `0.0`.
*   `_total_withdrawals_sum` (float): The cumulative sum of all funds ever withdrawn from the account. Used for P&L calculation. Initialized to `0.0`.

### `_record_transaction(self, type: str, **kwargs)`

**Description:**
A private helper method to record details of a transaction into the `_transactions` list. It automatically adds a timestamp and the account ID.

**Arguments:**
*   `type` (str): The type of transaction (e.g., 'account_created', 'deposit', 'withdraw', 'buy', 'sell').
*   `**kwargs`: Additional key-value pairs specific to the transaction type (e.g., `amount`, `symbol`, `quantity`, `price_per_share`, `current_balance`).

### `deposit(self, amount: float)`

**Description:**
Deposits funds into the account, increasing the cash balance and tracking the total deposits.

**Arguments:**
*   `amount` (float): The amount of money to deposit. Must be a positive number.

**Raises:**
*   `ValueError`: If the `amount` is not positive.

### `withdraw(self, amount: float)`

**Description:**
Withdraws funds from the account, decreasing the cash balance and tracking total withdrawals. Prevents withdrawals that would lead to a negative balance.

**Arguments:**
*   `amount` (float): The amount of money to withdraw. Must be a positive number.

**Raises:**
*   `ValueError`: If the `amount` is not positive or if there are insufficient funds.

### `buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int)`

**Description:**
Buys a specified quantity of shares for a given symbol. The cost is deducted from the cash balance. Prevents buying if insufficient funds are available.

**Arguments:**
*   `symbol` (str): The stock ticker symbol (will be converted to uppercase for internal storage).
*   `quantity` (int): The number of shares to buy. Must be a positive integer.

**Raises:**
*   `ValueError`: If `quantity` is not positive, if the symbol price is unavailable (from `get_share_price`), or if there are insufficient funds.

### `sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int)`

**Description:**
Sells a specified quantity of shares for a given symbol. The revenue is added to the cash balance. Prevents selling shares that the user does not own or more shares than they hold.

**Arguments:**
*   `symbol` (str): The stock ticker symbol (will be converted to uppercase for internal storage).
*   `quantity` (int): The number of shares to sell. Must be a positive integer.

**Raises:**
*   `ValueError`: If `quantity` is not positive, if the symbol price is unavailable (from `get_share_price`), or if the user does not own enough shares of that symbol.

### `get_balance(self) -> float`

**Description:**
Returns the current cash balance in the account.

**Returns:**
*   `float`: The current cash balance.

### `get_holdings(self) -> Dict[str, int]`

**Description:**
Returns a copy of the current share holdings in the account.

**Returns:**
*   `Dict[str, int]`: A dictionary where keys are stock symbols (uppercase) and values are the quantities held.

### `get_portfolio_value(self) -> float`

**Description:**
Calculates and returns the total value of the portfolio. This includes the current cash balance plus the current market value of all held shares, based on `get_share_price`.

**Returns:**
*   `float`: The total portfolio value.

### `get_profit_loss(self) -> float`

**Description:**
Calculates the current profit or loss of the portfolio. This is determined by subtracting the *net capital injected* (total deposits minus total withdrawals) from the current `get_portfolio_value()`.

**Returns:**
*   `float`: The profit or loss. A positive value indicates profit, a negative value indicates loss.

### `get_transactions(self) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]`

**Description:**
Returns a chronological list of all transactions made on this account. Each transaction is represented as a dictionary.

**Returns:**
*   `List[Dict[str, Any]]`: A list of transaction dictionaries. The list is a copy to prevent external modification of the internal transaction log.
